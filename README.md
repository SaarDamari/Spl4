# üõí BGU Mart ‚Äì Supermarket Chain Management System

A lightweight inventory and operations management system for supermarket chains, developed as part of an academic project at Ben-Gurion University.  
Built with Python 3 and SQLite3, BGU Mart allows full CRUD interaction with products, employees, suppliers, branches, and activity logs via command-line modules.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

BGU Mart is a database-backed tool that simulates real-world operations of a large supermarket chain.  
The system supports:

- Managing employees and suppliers
- Recording product deliveries and sales
- Maintaining inventory across multiple branches
- Generating detailed reports for auditing and tax purposes

---

## üß± Database Schema (SQLite3)

The system stores its data in a SQLite3 database named bgumart.db. It includes five normalized tables:

| Table      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| employees  | Employee details and branch association     |
| suppliers  | Supplier details and contact information    |
| products   | Inventory of items and stock levels         |
| branches   | Store branches and location information     |
| activities | Sales & supply transactions (timestamped)   |

Example schema definitions:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    salary REAL NOT NULL,
    branche INTEGER REFERENCES branches(id)
);

CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    contact_information TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE branches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    number_of_employees INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE activities (
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    activator_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL
);

## üß∞ Python Modules

The project is composed of three standalone command-line Python scripts:

### 1. initiate.py

Initializes a clean database using a configuration file.

Usage:

```bash
python3 initiate.py config.txt
```

* If bgumart.db exists, it will be deleted and rebuilt.
* Parses each line of the config.txt to insert employees, branches, suppliers, and products.

Line format examples:

* B,3,Chicago,40
* E,106,Sue Davis,75000,3
* P,5,Mango,2,7
* S,6,Jkl Enterprises,(678) 901-2345

---

### 2. action.py

Processes sales and delivery activities listed in an action file.

Usage:

```bash
python3 action.py actions.txt
```

* Each action updates product quantities accordingly.
* Sales are only performed if the product has sufficient stock.
* No partial sales or error messages are generated.

Line format examples:

* Supply: 3, 500, 56, 20230110
* Sale:   100, -200, 1234, 20230111

---

### 3. printdb.py

Displays the current database content and two detailed reports.

Usage:

```bash
python3 printdb.py
```

Output includes:

* All tables (Activities, Branches, Employees, Products, Suppliers) sorted by primary key or date.
* Detailed employee report:

  * name, salary, branch location, total sales income.
* Detailed activity report:

  * date, product description, quantity, seller name, supplier name.

All reports are generated using SQL JOINs and ORDER BY clauses as required.

---

## üìÑ Example Usage

Initialize:

```bash
python3 initiate.py config.txt
```

Run sales/deliveries:

```bash
python3 action.py actions.txt
```

View database and reports:

```bash
python3 printdb.py
```
